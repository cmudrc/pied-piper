This paper presents an open-source integrated simulation package for the component-level analysis of interdependent power-, water-, transport networks. The simulation platform, named ’InfraRisk’ and developed in Python, can simulate network-wide effects of disaster-induced infrastructure failures and subsequent post-disaster restoration. InfraRisk consists of an infrastructure module, a hazard module, a recovery module, a simulation module, and a resilience quantification module. The infrastructure module integrates existing infrastructure network packages (wntr for water distribution systems, pandapower for power systems, and a static traffic assignment model for road transport systems) through an interface that facilitates the network-level simulation of infrastructure failures. The hazard module generates infrastructure component failures based on various disaster characteristics. The recovery module determines repair sequences and assigns repair crews based on predefined heuristics-based recovery strategies or model predictive control (MPC) based optimization. Based on the schedule, the simulation module simulates the consequences of the disaster impacts and the recovery actions on the performance of the interdependent network. The resilience quantification module offers system-level and consumer-level metrics to quantify both the risks and resilience of the integrated infrastructure networks against disaster events. InfraRisk provides a virtual platform for decision-makers to experiment and develop region-specific pre-disaster and post-disaster policies to enhance the overall resilience of interdependent urban infrastructure networks.}

The water-energy-food nexus requires integrating tools to guide the allocation of resources and promote sustainability. This work presents a mathematical formulation for the optimal design and management of resources to enhance the water-energy-food nexus security. Resource security is measured through indicators related to the availability, access, and sufficiency of water, energy, and food. Furthermore, the problem was analyzed under different allocation schemes (social welfare, Rawlsian, Nash, and Rawlsian-Nash) to maximize the global resource security (including water, energy, and food) and obtain the optimal design of the system. Therefore, the water, energy, and food security indices are considered as the objectives of interest. To show the applicability of the model, a Mexican state evaluated by regions was selected as a case study. Results show that through this approach, the security of the water, energy, and food sectors could be increased 6\%, 56\%, and 26\%, respectively, and 27\% the security of the water-energy-food nexus using the social welfare scheme in the addressed case study. The proposed water-energy-food nexus framework can be applied to any region with the corresponding data.},

This paper provides a comprehensive literature review to debate the current concepts and methods of the FEW nexus at different scales, with the aim of developing a conceptual knowledgebase framework for scientific analysis and policy making associated with the urban FEW nexus. Although the concept of nexus thinking has been widely accepted, a consistent and explicit cognition of the FEW nexus is still lacking, and a sophisticated methodological modeling framework is urgently required at various scales. As such, we proposed a three-dimensional conceptual framework of the urban FEW nexus from the perspective of resource interdependency, resource provision and system integration. This framework is useful in steering the systematic modeling and integrative management of the complex nexus issues of urban systems with different perspectives. Finally, the future directions of urban nexus research are identified from four aspects, including systematic characterization, cross-region tele-connection mechanisms, co-decision model development, and governance transition.}

    abstract = { An accurate assessment of actual pavement condition and its future performance is essential in developing effective pavement management systems. The main drawbacks in the current developed deterioration models are that they do not examine pavement deterioration transition time and transition probabilities from one state condition to the next. Omitting transition time or transition probabilities between pavement condition states while developing pavement management models results in deterministic models that do not consider the probabilistic nature of the pavement deterioration process. This study overcomes the drawbacks in current developed deterioration models and proposes a methodology that can provide new insights into the development of long-term probabilistic pavement management tools. For this purpose, data were collected on pavement roughness, macrotexture, and age for major roads in Jordan. In addition, the vehicle speed while measuring pavement condition and macrotexture was recorded and used in the analyses. The collected data were analyzed using both fully parametric and semiparametric multistate survival approaches to identify the factors that affect pavement performance deterioration and to predict the transition probabilities between pavement condition states throughout pavement useful life. The performance of the developed models was evaluated using common statistical metrics developed in literature. The results demonstrated that the described methodology could complement conventional asset management approaches and provide descriptive and formal additional insights into road system management. }

    ABSTRACT = {Proper road network maintenance is essential for ensuring safety, reducing transportation costs, and improving fuel efficiency. Traditional pavement condition assessments rely on specialized equipment, limiting the frequency and scope of inspections due to technical and financial constraints. In response, crowdsourcing data from connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offers an innovative alternative. CAVs, equipped with sensors and accelerometers by Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), continuously gather real-time data on road conditions. This study evaluates the feasibility of using CAV data to assess pavement condition through the International Roughness Index (IRI). By comparing CAV-derived data with traditional pavement auscultation results, various thresholds were established to quantitatively and qualitatively define pavement conditions. The results indicate a moderate positive correlation between the two datasets, particularly in segments with good-to-satisfactory surface conditions (IRI 1 to 2.5 dm/km). Although the IRI values from CAVs tended to be slightly lower than those from auscultation surveys, this difference can be attributed to driving behavior. Nonetheless, our analysis shows that CAV data can be used to reliably identify pavement conditions, offering a scalable, non-destructive, and continuous monitoring solution. This approach could enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of traditional road inspection campaigns.},

As a standardized document for providing a consistent, logical and readable account of the structure and dynamics of ABMs, some research groups also find it useful as a workflow for model design. Even so, there are still limitations to ODD that obstruct its more widespread adoption. Such limitations are discussed and addressed in this paper: the limited availability of guidance on how to use ODD; the length of ODD documents; limitations of ODD for highly complex models; lack of sufficient details of many ODDs to enable reimplementation without access to the model code; and the lack of provision for sections in the document structure covering model design rationale, the model&rsquo;s underlying narrative, and the means by which the model&rsquo;s fitness for purpose is evaluated. We document the steps we have taken to provide better guidance on: structuring complex ODDs and an ODD summary for inclusion in a journal article (with full details in supplementary material; Table 1); using ODD to point readers to relevant sections of the model code; update the document structure to include sections on model rationale and evaluation. We also further advocate the need for standard descriptions of simulation experiments and argue that ODD can in principle be used for any type of simulation model. Thereby ODD would provide a lingua franca for simulation modelling.},

Part of their popularity is due to their ability to simulate individual behaviours and decisions over space and time. However, whilst there are plentiful examples within the academic literature, these models are only beginning to make an impact within policy areas. Whilst frameworks such as NetLogo make the creation of ABMs relatively easy, a number of key methodological issues, including the quantification of uncertainty, remain. In this paper we draw on state-of-the-art approaches from the fields of uncertainty quantification and model optimisation to describe a novel framework for the calibration of ABMs using History Matching and Approximate Bayesian Computation. The utility of the framework is demonstrated on three example models of increasing complexity: (i) Sugarscape to illustrate the approach on a toy example; (ii) a model of the movement of birds to explore the efficacy of our framework and compare it to alternative calibration approaches and; (iii) the RISC model of farmer decision making to demonstrate its value in a real application. The results highlight the efficiency and accuracy with which this approach can be used to calibrate ABMs. This method can readily be applied to local or national-scale ABMs, such as those linked to the creation or tailoring of key policy decisions.},

It enables us to comprehend complex relationships between humans and infrastructure after natural hazards. Existing studies have identified individual recovery, which focuses on personal or household-level restoration, and systematic recovery, which focuses on broader community recovery processes. However, they have not described how individual recoveries contribute to the overall recovery. To close the gap, we propose an agent-based model (ABM), called Disaster Infrastructure Recovery Simulator (DIRSim). We apply DIRSim to analyze the recovery of five counties in Texas following Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Specifically, we construct a three-layer network, composed of a human layer, a social infrastructure layer, and a physical infrastructure layer, using mobile phone location data and point-of-interest foot traffic data. Based on this three-layer network, we develop the ABM to simulate how evacuated users return to their homes, and social and physical infrastructure recover using a household survey. By implementing the ABM, we unveil the heterogeneity in recovery dynamics regarding geographical locations, housing types, and income levels. Moreover, simulation results across nine scenarios quantify the positive recovery effects of social and physical infrastructure policies.}

    abstract = {The housing sector is an important part of every community. It directly affects people, constitutes a major share of the building market, and shapes the community. Meanwhile, the increase of developments in hazard-prone areas along with the intensification of extreme events has amplified the potential for disaster-induced losses. Consequently, housing recovery is of vital importance to the overall restoration of a community. In this relation, recovery models can help with devising data-driven policies that can better identify pre-disaster mitigation needs and post-disaster recovery priorities by predicting the possible outcomes of different plans. Although several recovery models have been proposed, there are still gaps in the understanding of how decisions made by individuals and different entities interact to output the recovery. Additionally, integrating spatial aspects of recovery is a missing key in many models. The current research proposes a spatial model for simulation and prediction of homeowners&rsquo; recovery decisions through incorporating recovery drivers that could capture interactions of individual, communal, and organizational decisions. RecovUS is a spatial agent-based model for which all the input data can be obtained from publicly available data sources. The model is presented using the data on the recovery of Staten Island, New York, after Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The results confirm that the combination of internal, interactive, and external drivers of recovery affect households&rsquo; decisions and shape the progress of recovery.},

    ABSTRACT = {Extreme weather can cause severe damage and widespread power outages across utility service areas. The restoration process can be long and costly and emergency managers may have limited computational resources to optimize the restoration process. This study takes an agent based modeling (ABM) approach to optimize the utility storm recovery process in Connecticut. The ABM is able to replicate past storm recoveries and can test future case scenarios. We found that parameters such as the number of outages, repair time range and the number of utility crews working can substantially impact the estimated time to restoration (ETR). Other parameters such as crew starting locations and travel speeds had comparatively minor impacts on the ETR. The ABM can be used to train new emergency managers as well as test strategies for storm restoration optimization.},

    abstract = {Abstract In this paper, a comprehensive community-level model is developed advancing the use of agent-based modeling for the purpose of community resilience planning. Agents to simulate businesses, healthcare system, and people are introduced, which are utilized along with a set of developed agents for the education system, utilities, and households to create an agent-based model of the Centerville testbed subjected to tornado hazards. Resilience measures are also introduced to quantify the resilience of the community and its systems and make it possible to assess various strategies related to pre-disaster preparedness for informed decision-making. The results show the capability of the proposed computational model to capture the complex behaviors and dynamics of interdependent systems within a community and to evaluate the impact of disruptions on the community as well as a series of resilience measures (mitigation strategies) for the purposes of community planning. Therefore, the proposed model and its findings could provide a new tool for interested community stakeholders and decision-makers assessing mitigation strategies to enhance the recovery time and resilience of the community.},

    abstract = {Flood risk emerges from the dynamic interaction between natural hazards and human vulnerability. Methods for the quantification of flood risk are well established, but tend to deal with human and economic vulnerability as being static or changing with an exogenously defined trend. In this paper we present an Agent-Based Model (ABM) developed to simulate the dynamical evolution of flood risk and vulnerability, and facilitate an investigation of insurance mechanism in London. The ABM has been developed to firstly allow an analysis of the vulnerability of homeowners to surface water flooding, which is one of the greatest short-term climate risks in the UK with estimated annual costs of &pound;1.3bn to &pound;2.2bn. These costs have been estimated to increase by 60-220\% over the next 50 years due to climate change and urbanisation. Vulnerability is influenced by homeowner&rsquo;s decisions to move house and/or install measures to protect their properties from flooding. In particular, the ABM focuses on the role of flood insurance, simulating the current public-private partnership between the government and insurers in the UK, and the forthcoming re-insurance scheme Flood Re, designed as a roadmap to support the future affordability and availability of flood insurance. The ABM includes interaction between homeowners, sellers and buyers, an insurer, a local government and a developer. Detailed GIS and qualitative data of the London borough of Camden are used to represent an area at high risk of surface water flooding. The ABM highlights how future development can exacerbate current levels of surface water flood risk in Camden. Investment in flood protection measures are shown to be beneficial for reducing surface water flood risk. The Flood Re scheme is shown to achieve its aim of securing affordable flood insurance premiums, however, is placed under increasing pressure in the future as the risk of surface water flooding continues to increase.},

	abstract = {A* is a search algorithm that has long been used in the pathfinding research community. Its efficiency, simplicity, and modularity are often highlighted as its strengths compared to other tools. Due to its ubiquity and widespread usage, A* has become a common option for researchers attempting to solve pathfinding problems. However, the sheer amount of research done on the topic makes it difficult to know where to start looking. With this paper, we hope to create an accessible, up to date reference on the current state of the A* search algorithm for future pathfinding projects to consider. This paper examines A-Star’s current usage in the field of pathfinding, comparing A* to other search algorithms. It also analyzes potential future developments for A-Star’s development. A* cannot keep up with the demands of current pathfinding problems. Other algorithms can maintain the same performance while also demanding less overhead and this problem only grows worse as grid size increases. However, use of innovative modifications such as different heuristic types or secondary components to the algorithm allow A* to achieve very fast times with good accuracy when dealing with large maps, while only having slightly increased overhead costs for the modifications. While beginning to show its age, improved algorithms based on the classic A* algorithm are more than capable of keeping up with modern pathfinding demands. These derivative search algorithms such as HPA* is used to overcome the limitations of A*. HPA* can compete with and even surpass its competitors depending on the challenge faced.},
