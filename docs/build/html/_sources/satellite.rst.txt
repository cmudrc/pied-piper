Working with Satellite Data
========================

PiperABM can seamlessly ingest satellite imagery and geospatial datasets to build simulation-ready infrastructure models. Below are guides to help you import, preprocess, and integrate satellite data into your modeling workflows.


.. _mercator-projection:

Mercator Projection
--------------------------------
As we already saw in the :ref:`Step 1: Build the Infrastructure <step-1-build-infrastructure>` section of the :ref:`Step-by-Step Usage Guide <step-by-step-usage-guide>`, the PiperABM framework expects `x`, `y` coordinates for the positions. However, many satellite datasets and maps provide data in latitude and longitude coordinates. To convert these coordiantes to `x` and `y`, we can use the Mercator projection.

   **Figure 1:** The Mercator projection is a cylindrical map projection. Imagine wrapping a piece of paper around a globe to form a cylinder. The map image is whatâ€™s projected from the 3D globe onto the 2D surface of the paper. Source: `NOAA <https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/navigation/making-nautical-charts.html>`_

In this transformation, the reference point is the latitude and longitude of a specific location, which will become the origin `(0, 0)` in the `x`, `y` coordinate system. The Mercator projection, as seen in Figure 1, wrapps the 3D globe and distorts the shapes. The areas closer to the reference point will be more accurate and less distortedm while areas further away will be more distorted. This is important to keep in mind when working with large areas or when the reference point is not centrally located.

.. code-block:: python

    from piperabm.tools.coordinate.projection import latlong_xy

    # Reference point
    latitude_0 = 40.0520
    longitude_0 = -74.0232

    # Points in latitude and longitude
    points = [
        [40.7128, -74.0060],
        [40.0522, -74.0240],
        [40.1234, -74.0567]
    ]

    # Convert to x, y coordinates using Mercator projection
    for point in points:
        x, y = latlong_xy(
            latitude_0,
            longitude_0,
            latitude=point[0],
            longitude=point[1]
        )
        print(x, y)

.. _meshing-residential-areas:

Meshing Residential Areas
--------------------------------
To add home nodes to the model, we already see that we can use the `add_home` method of the `Infrastructure` class. However, it is not always practical to add hundreds or thausand of homes one by one.
When working with satellite data and maps, we can create mesh patches that represent and cover the residential areas. These patches are then used to generate random points that represent the homes in the model.

To do so, first, we define the points that form the vertices of the triangles (Figure 2(a)). If the points are in latitude and longitude, convert them to `x` and `y` coordinates using the Mercator projection that has been discussed above.
Then, we create `Triangle` instances for each triangle formed by the points. Finally, we create a `Patch` instance that contains these triangles (Figure 2(b)). The `Patch` instance can then be used to generate random points within the defined area.
Another capability of the `Triangle` is that it can have a `density` atttribute, defaulting to 1, which controles chance of point generation in the area. This is useful since not all residential areas have the same density of homes.

   **Figure 2:** (a) Points are labeled and their coordinates are extracted. These points will either/or be used for defining streets and creationg of homes nodes. (b) The mesh patch is created using the points as the vertices of the triangles. Home nodes will be placed randomly inside this area.

.. code-block:: python
    
    import piperabm as pa
    from piperabm.tools.mesh import Triangle, Patch
    
    model = pa.Model()

    # We define the points that from the vertices of the triangle.
    # Figure 2(a)
    point_1 = [0, 0]
    point_2 = [10, 0]
    point_3 = [10, 12]
    ...

    # Then, we create define the triangle formed by the points.
    # Figure 2(b)
    triangle_1 = Triangle(point_1, point_23, point_8)
    triangle_2 = Triangle(point_3, point_43, point_5)
    triangle_3 = Triangle(point_6, point_52, ponint_27)
    ...

    # We create a Patch instance that containts these triangles.
    patch = Patch([
        triangle_1,
        triangle_2,
        triangle_3,
        ...
    ])

    # We can now generate random points within the defined area.
    for _ in range(100):  # Generate random points
        point = patch.random_point()
        model.infrastructure.add_home(pos=point, name='home')
