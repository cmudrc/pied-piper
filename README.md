## Introduction
<NOT COMPLETE>
Earth’s climate is always changing, and people who study Earth see that its climate is getting warmer. As we observe drastic changes to Arctic environments, such as snow and ice melt, human communities in the Arctic will also drastically change. One of the greatest challenges in Arctic communities which impacts all life in these regions is permafrost thaw. Permafrost can be up to 70 percent ice, the thawing of which results in damage to the built environment and, ultimately, the lives of people who are part of Arctic communities.

A socio-ecological system is “characterized by feedbacks, which occur between human values, perceptions, and behaviors and the biophysical components of the ecosystems in which people exist resulting in a resilient or vulnerable trajectory leading to sustainability or collapse.” Both the social and ecological components of these systems are interrelated. Agent-Based Modeling approach can be beneficial in gaining insight about this problem.
